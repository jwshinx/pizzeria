# Pizzeria

Pizzeria is a Rails app. Rides on Docker. Mostly an API, to be consumed by React frontend (WIP).

## Installation

Rails 6.0.5, Ruby 3.0.2, Tailwind

## Usage

I tried to install typescript. But got entangled in dependency hell. It seems i need to downgrade certain packages to older versions - a rabbit hole.

I'm going to leave it here. the app runs and loads fine. No typescript.
